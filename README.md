# Virtual Rock Paper Scissors

A virtual twist to rock paper scissors! Two players will compete against each other by choosing one of three hand gestures, comparing their choices after the draw to determine the game. It is a win, lose, or tie - the person who lost will lose a life. Keep playing until you no longer have any lives left.
